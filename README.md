# **Probabilistic Outputs for Support Vector Machines and Comparisons to Regularized Likelihood Methods**

This method is used for **converting raw SVM decision function outputs into well-calibrated probability estimates** using **Platt Scaling**.

## **Overview**
- SVMs provide a **decision function output** that does not directly represent probabilities.
- Platt Scaling fits a **sigmoid function** to the SVM scores to produce probabilistic outputs.
